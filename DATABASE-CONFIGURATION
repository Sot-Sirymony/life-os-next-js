**Note**: This project uses PostgreSQL on port 5433 and the app typically runs on port 3001. Always check the terminal output for the correct URLs when starting the development server.

PgAdmin is running on port 8080, not 5050.
To view your database, open your browser and go to:
http://localhost:8080
Login credentials:
Email: admin@lifeos.com
Password: admin123
Let me know if you can access it now! If you want to use a different port or credentials, I can help you update the configuration.



Great! Now that you can open PgAdmin, here’s what to do next to view and manage your database:

---

## 1. **Log in to PgAdmin**
- Go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- **Email:** `admin@lifeos.com`
- **Password:** `admin123`

---

## 2. **Register a New Server**
1. In the left sidebar, right-click on **Servers** and select **Register > Server...**
2. In the **General** tab, set:
   - **Name:** `Life OS` (or any name you like)
3. In the **Connection** tab, fill in:
   - **Host name/address:** `postgres`
   - **Port:** `5432`
   - **Username:** `postgres`
   - **Password:** `password`
   - (You can check “Save Password” if you want)
4. Click **Save**.

---

## 3. **Browse Your Database**
- Expand the new server you just created.
- Expand **Databases > life_os_dev > Schemas > public > Tables**.
- Right-click any table (like `User`, `Goal`, or `Task`) and select **View/Edit Data > All Rows** to see your data.

---

## 4. **You Can Also:**
- Run SQL queries using the **Query Tool** (right-click the database and select "Query Tool").
- Inspect table structures, relationships, and more.

---

### ⚠️ **Note**
- The **Host name/address** should be `postgres` (the Docker service name), not `localhost`, when connecting from PgAdmin running in Docker.
- If you get a connection error, try `localhost` and port `5433` instead.
